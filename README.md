# Simple JokeBot for Slack

This is a super simplified `slack bot` app with a lot of unnecessary dulications. It's for learning purpose only, do nut use in production`(You've been warned)`

This is assuming that you can create a simple slack app else visit `https://api.slack.com` to setup your app

The rest is straight forward from there

## Setup

Clone the project and run `npm install` to get started

Once you have your app setup on Slack, just simply grab the `OAuth Access Token` and store it in your environment variable

Run the command below to setup the environment variable or you can use any dotenv package

On Mac/Unix run
```
export SLACKBOT_TOKEN=************************
```
